   If that doesn't work, try:
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

STEP 3: RUN THE APPLICATION

TROUBLESHOOTING

Problem: "pip is not recognized"
Solution: Try using: python -m pip instead of pip

Problem: Dependencies won't install
Solution: Make sure you have internet connection and try:
          python -m pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Problem: Can't fetch metadata from URL
Solution: Some sites block automated requests. Use manual entry instead.
